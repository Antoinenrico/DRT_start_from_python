## **1. Introduction to the Voigt Circuit Function**

In the domain of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the response of multiple RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits, both in series and parallel configurations, can be modeled as intricate electrical analogues representing the intricate physicochemical processes in the medium.

The Voigt circuit, often identified as a parallel RC circuit, stands as an archetypal representation in EIS. Its significance arises from its ability to transition insights from the frequency domain to the time domain, thereby elucidating the dynamic interplay in electrochemical systems.

The Voigt function combines the characteristics of two elementary responses: the Lorentzian response (related to a resistor and capacitor in parallel) and the Gaussian response. This combination effectively ties the frequency behavior of an electrochemical system to its temporal response. Understanding the Voigt function is essential for interpreting impedance data, especially when discerning between different relaxation processes in complex systems.

Mathematically, the impedance of a parallel RC circuit (Voigt element) is given by:

\[
Z(\omega) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R} + j\omega C}
\]

![Z_omega](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Z(\omega)&space;=&space;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R}&space;+&space;j\omega&space;C})

Where:
- \( Z(\omega) \) is the impedance as a function of angular frequency \( \omega \).
- \( R \) is the resistance.
- \( C \) is the capacitance.
- \( j \) is the imaginary unit.

The Voigt function is :

## **2. Ridge Regression**

Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. The regularization term discourages overly complex models which can lead to overfitting. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a parameter, often denoted as \( \lambda \). 

- **Mathematically**, Ridge regression seeks to minimize the following:

\[
\text{Cost function} = ||Y - X\beta||^2_2 + \lambda||\beta||^2_2
\]

Where:
- \( Y \) is the output vector.
- \( X \) is the input matrix.
- \( \beta \) is the coefficient vector.
- \( \lambda \) is the regularization parameter.

The ridge regression tends to shrink the coefficients, and this can be particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity. In the context of this project, Ridge Regression is employed to robustly estimate the DRT from impedance data.



## **3. Assistance & Improvements**

We believe in the power of collaborative development. If you have suggestions, improvements, or find any bugs, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. 

Whether you're a novice looking to learn or an expert with insights to share, your contributions are welcome. Together, we can enhance this project and make it a valuable resource for everyone. we target those part : 

- Work on the implementation of the DRT algorithm (Use the minimized function is not relevant)
- Work on the visualization of the DRT algorithm
- Charge of integrating Ridge Regression for robust DRT estimation.
- Assisted in data preprocessing and refining the Jupyter Notebook (maybe some matrix simplification).

## **1. Introduction to RC Circuitry & Cole-Cole Plots**

In the field of electrochemistry and impedance spectroscopy, the behavior of multiple RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits in series and parallel configurations can be complex. The Cole-Cole plot, a variant of the Nyquist plot, offers an insightful graphical representation of impedance data, allowing for the visualization of the relaxation processes in these circuits. 

In a Cole-Cole plot, the real part of the impedance (Z') is plotted against the imaginary part of the impedance (Z''), forming a semicircular profile. The frequency-dependent behavior of these plots provides information on the distribution of relaxation times in the system, which is particularly important in systems like solid-state electrolytes, biological cells, and more.

## **2. Ridge Regression**

Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. The regularization term discourages overly complex models which can lead to overfitting. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a parameter, often denoted as \( \lambda \). 

- **Mathematically**, Ridge regression seeks to minimize the following:

\[
\text{Cost function} = ||Y - X\beta||^2_2 + \lambda||\beta||^2_2
\]

Where:
- \( Y \) is the output vector.
- \( X \) is the input matrix.
- \( \beta \) is the coefficient vector.
- \( \lambda \) is the regularization parameter.

The ridge regression tends to shrink the coefficients, and this can be particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity. In the context of this project, Ridge Regression is employed to robustly estimate the DRT from impedance data.



## **3. Assistance & Improvements**

We believe in the power of collaborative development. If you have suggestions, improvements, or find any bugs, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. 

Whether you're a novice looking to learn or an expert with insights to share, your contributions are welcome. Together, we can enhance this project and make it a valuable resource for everyone. we target those part : 

- Work on the implementation of the DRT algorithm (Use the minimized function is not relevant)
- Work on the visualization of the DRT algorithm
- Charge of integrating Ridge Regression for robust DRT estimation.
- Assisted in data preprocessing and refining the Jupyter Notebook (maybe some matrix simplification).
